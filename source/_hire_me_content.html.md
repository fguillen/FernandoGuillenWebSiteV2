## What I do

I specialize in **Full stack web development**,
Rails projects maintenance,
architecture consulting and technical team leadership.

## What I don't do

Although I appreciate aesthetics, have an art studies background and have designed my own pet projects,
I consider myself a creative person rather than a professional graphic designer. Therefore,
**I don't offer professional web design services**. Additionally,

suit many clients, I focus on providing unique, tailored solutions.

I **am adaptable to client decision changes**, offering quick and seamless adjustments.

I leverage **the most efficient web development tools** to deliver superior results efficiently.

While I specialize in back-end development, I possess comprehensive knowledge across
**all phases and layers of web development**, including functional analysis,
team management, usability decisions, front-end development (JavaScript, CSS, HTML),
server configuration and maintenance, databases, and more.

I maintain **regular contact with high-level professionals** in my field,
we offer each other mutual support and ensure solutions are always within reach.

Client satisfaction is my main concern.
I have never left a client in the lurch, and to my knowledge,

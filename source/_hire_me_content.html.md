## What I do

I do **high quality ad-hoc web applications development**.

## What I don't do

Although I love beautiful things, I used to design my own pet-projects
and consider myself a creative person,
I am not a professional graphic designer.
**I don't do professional web design**.
Amongst other things because I'm not good on it.

**I don't do multi-purpose CMS integrations**.
For many clients, a generic software solution is the best
answer. These are readily available, often free, from the
Internet. I don't do this kind of work.
I am where an unique solution is needed.

## Why hire me

I have a lot of experience in web development, I am a **mature developer**, **business focused** and **productive**.

I'm **not a competitive professional**,
I will honestly say whether or not if I would be
the best person for your project. If I am not I can
refer you to some more suitable colleagues.

I **can accommodate
client decision changes**. I can make changes quickly
and easily.

I use **the most productive web development tools**
so I can produce better results faster.

Although my speciality is the back-end development,
I have a good knowledge of **every phase and layer of web development**.
Functional analysis, team management, usability decisions,
XHTML/CSS, front development (JavaScript, CSS, HTML),
servers configuration and maintenance,
databases, etc...

I am in **regular contact with high level professionals**
in the same field of work and we offer each other mutual
support, so there is always a solution to be found.

My main concern is **client satisfaction**.
I have never
left a client in the lurch and so far, as I am aware, I
have never had a dissatisfied client.

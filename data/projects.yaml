    I hands-on directed the implementation from scratch of an architecture that now supports more than 100K requests/min and a business of 8 figures. I leaded the technology decisions of a team of ~80 members.

    - 500M Micro-Surveys per month
    - 220K Respondents per day in 100+ countries
    - 100K Requests/minute
    - DBs with 5K IOPs
    - 500 Servers
    - 30 Micro services

    I took the role of CTO and one of the co-founders at Dalia and my key responsibility was to create a great technical architecture
    that is easy to work with and that is capable of rapidly adapting to the business needs.

    I formed part of the Engineering Teams (Development, Data Science, DevOps and Quality Assurance).

    I participated in any initiative that requires technology support.
    Including technical advice, high level strategic technical decisions, technical architecture design, inter product technical dependencies, third-party technologies integrations.

    I got involved in any management-related initiative related to Engineering.

    I also participated in giving strategy consulting support for business high perspective initiatives.

    As one of the co-founders I also took part of strategic initiatives decisions and represented company in the investors funding due diligences.

    I took care of the technology decisions, I implemented the backend architecture, defined the deployment process, coordination of the IT resources.
    Worked side by side with the product team. I made real, in a technological perspective, the CEO vision.

    Appbounty was a spin-off from a big ad-tech company.
    Thanks for the good CEO vision and the very good management of the technical resources the project
    moves in six months from the pet-project of a big company to a very profitable product generating 6 figures dollars per month.

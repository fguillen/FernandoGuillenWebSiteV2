    Latana is helping brands make better marketing decisions by delivering world-class, scalable insights.

    Their technology is based in the architecture I built for Dalia Research.

    In 2022 they made a big restructuring of the thechnology based in Rails microservices. Part
    of it was adquired by a US based company.

    I was accountable for the design and execution of the Ruby on Rails platform technology assets
    purchase transfer strategy between Latana and the international partner buyer.

    I led the process, from the technology perspective, synchronising with both companies tech teams
    and executing the needed steps for the successful and smooth assets transfer, which includes
    dozens of Ruby no Rails microservices, huge DBs and big data services. Mostly based on Ruby ecosystems.

    Successfully completed complex tech transfer, adjusted to budget and ahead of time.
    Successes included making the transition in the estimated time without any outage in the systems,
    handover and document the important knowhow base, handholding new developers to feel
    comfortable with the systems.

    I took care of the technology decisions, I implemented the backend architecture, defined the deployment process, coordination of the IT resources.
    Worked side by side with the product team. I made real, in a technological perspective, the CEO vision.

    Appbounty was a spin-off from a big ad-tech company.
    Thanks for the good CEO vision and the very good management of the technical resources the project
    moves in six months from the pet-project of a big company to a very profitable product generating 6 figures dollars per month.

  text: |-
    One friend of me said he missed a custom iphone application for answer for the spanish verb conjugations. He is english spoken but he is learning spanish. He said that with that kind of help he would be allowed to talk more intelligently.

    So I decided to develop this application for him as a christmas present.

    The first beta version was working on 3 hours.

    It is a web application but try to looks like iPhone native one. Is not Rails but Sinatra. And the core of the application is a work of screen-scrapping another webs.

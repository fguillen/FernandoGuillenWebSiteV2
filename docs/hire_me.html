<h2>What I do</h2>

<p>I do <strong>high quality ad-hoc web applications development</strong>.</p>

<h2>What I don&rsquo;t do</h2>

<p>Although I love beautiful things, I used to design my own pet-projects
and consider myself a creative person,
I am not a professional graphic designer.
<strong>I don&rsquo;t do professional web design</strong>.
Amongst other things because I&rsquo;m not good on it.</p>

<p><strong>I don&rsquo;t do multi-purpose CMS integrations</strong>.
For many clients, a generic software solution is the best
answer. These are readily available, often free, from the
Internet. I don&rsquo;t do this kind of work.
I am where an unique solution is needed.</p>

<h2>Why hire me</h2>

<p>I have a lot of experience in web development, I am a <strong>mature developer</strong>, <strong>business focused</strong> and <strong>productive</strong>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m <strong>not a competitive professional</strong>,
I will honestly say whether or not if I would be
the best person for your project. If I am not I can
refer you to some more suitable colleagues.</p>

<p>I <strong>can accommodate
client decision changes</strong>. I can make changes quickly
and easily.</p>

<p>I use <strong>the most productive web development tools</strong>
so I can produce better results faster.</p>

<p>Although my speciality is the back-end development,
I have a good knowledge of <strong>every phase and layer of web development</strong>.
Functional analysis, team management, usability decisions,
XHTML/CSS, front development (JavaScript, CSS, HTML),
servers configuration and maintenance,
databases, etc&hellip;</p>

<p>I am in <strong>regular contact with high level professionals</strong>
in the same field of work and we offer each other mutual
support, so there is always a solution to be found.</p>

<p>My main concern is <strong>client satisfaction</strong>.
I have never
left a client in the lurch and so far, as I am aware, I
have never had a dissatisfied client.</p>

<h2>How to hire me</h2>

<p>Read all the details on this page. Let me know if you have any question. Talk me about you, about your project and about your team.</p>

<p>Let me know how can I help you and what do you expect from me.</p>

<h2>How I work</h2>

<p>I work in a freelancer contractual arrangement.</p>

<p>I work on <strong>weekly milestones</strong>,
<strong>daily activity reports</strong>,
<strong>full and continuos contact
with the client and with the team</strong>.
I usually work <strong>remotely</strong>,
but personal meetings are possible if we decide they will
offer something valuable and productive for the project.</p>

<p>If long commuting is required travel and accommodation
costs will be remunerated by the client.</p>

<p>I am in the Berlin time zone (Central European Summer Time)</p>

<h2>What is my budget</h2>

<p>Depending on the intensity and time-scale of the project,
my rate is <strong>900â‚¬/day</strong> plus taxes.</p>

<p>Even the simplest web service needs at least 4 to 6
weeks development and cannot be started until I have
finished any work in hand.
The great majority of projects take about <strong>8 ~ 12 weeks</strong>
until a public beta version is released and ~ 4 weeks more of
fixing and stabilizing the whole functionality
of the project.</p>

<p>Payments to be made weekly.</p>

        <p class="  fs-5 col-md- 8 ">Hello, I am Fernando, I am original from Spain, but I've been living last decade in Berlin. I am experienced full stack web developer with more of 20 years of substantial background building small and big technical products. I can help you to build the technology product and technical architecture your business needs.</p>

        <p>Full-stack web developer, primarily using Ruby on Rails and associated technologies.</p>

<p>I am a specialist in getting technology products off the ground, from design idea to fully functional application. Focus on production quality, but also on fast feedback loops: deliver fast and iterate. On this role I have worked for start-ups, big companies and also on personal entrepreneurial projects. As an &ldquo;individual contributor&rdquo; or as part of a small or large engineering team, as a senior developer or leading architecture decisions.</p>

<p>Most recently in my role as a Co-founder and CTO of a fast growing technology company, I was hands-on directing the implementation from scratch of an architecture that now supports more than 100K requests/min and a business of 8 figures. Leading the technology decisions of a team of ~80 members.</p>

<p>I primarily work on Rails applications, but have a solid exposure to the full web development stack.</p>

<p>At one time or another, I have been in charge of: prototyping, implementing deployment CI based processes, cloud based servers administration, working on or directing scrum teams, working hand by hand with the product team, suffering the hell of having to make C level decisions, microservices, high load traffic, fraud prevention, performance monitoring, autoscaling, terabytes sized DBs, APIs design, &hellip;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also had plenty of exposure to different languages including python, C#, Java. And of course most of the modern JS frameworks like React and VueJS.</p>

<p>&hellip; But Ruby is what I enjoy working the most.</p>

<p>I am not just a developer, I have sensibility for the business needs, I know when to make compromises, when to cut corners, when to offer alternatives. I am used to working elbow to elbow with the product, sales and leader teams.</p>

<p>I have had the luck of having been always surrounded by incredibly well talented people. I have learned everything I know from them. I owe everything I know to the people of the teams I have worked in, to the community around open source, web development in general and Ruby in particular.</p>

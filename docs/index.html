        <p class="  fs-5 col-md- 8 ">Hello, I am Fernando, I am original from Spain, but I've been living last decade in Berlin. I am experienced full stack web developer with more of 20 years of substantial background building small and big technical products. I can help you to build the technology product and technical architecture your business needs.</p>

        <p>Full-stack web developer, primarily using Ruby on Rails and associated technologies.</p>

<p>I am a specialist in getting technology products off the ground, from design idea to fully functional application. Focus on production quality, but also on fast feedback loops: deliver fast and iterate. On this role I have worked for start-ups, big companies and also on personal entrepreneurial projects. As an &ldquo;individual contributor&rdquo; or as part of a small or large engineering team, as a senior developer or leading architecture decisions.</p>

<p>Most recently in my role as a Co-founder and CTO of a fast growing technology company, I was hands-on directing the implementation from scratch of an architecture that now supports more than 100K requests/min and a business of 8 figures. Leading the technology decisions of a team of ~80 members.</p>

<p>I primarily work on Rails applications, but have a solid exposure to the full web development stack.</p>

<p>At one time or another, I have been in charge of: prototyping, implementing deployment CI based processes, cloud based servers administration, working on or directing scrum teams, working hand by hand with the product team, suffering the hell of having to make C level decisions, microservices, high load traffic, fraud prevention, performance monitoring, autoscaling, terabytes sized DBs, APIs design, &hellip;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also had plenty of exposure to different languages including python, C#, Java. And of course most of the modern JS frameworks like React and VueJS.</p>

<p>&hellip; But Ruby is what I enjoy working the most.</p>

<p>I am not just a developer, I have sensibility for the business needs, I know when to make compromises, when to cut corners, when to offer alternatives. I am used to working elbow to elbow with the product, sales and leader teams.</p>

<p>I have had the luck of having been always surrounded by incredibly well talented people. I have learned everything I know from them. I owe everything I know to the people of the teams I have worked in, to the community around open source, web development in general and Ruby in particular.</p>

      <p>I had the honor and pleasure to work closely with Fernando for several years and I’m convinced that he is the most talented Engineer I’ve ever met. At that time he was the CTO of the company I joined and I could witness him building an impressive and complex distributed architecture from the ground up, an architecture that scaled flawlessly over the years up to millions of users sessions through several microservices and API integrations with third party partners. His talent in designing an elastic resilient and versatile system from the very start was what made possible for the company to keep growing exponentially and expand their business without technical constraints.</p>

<p>He is a well rounded engineer, he’s a passionate rubyst and a true talent in full stack development with Rails, but he is also able to jump into every technology and learn it in no time.</p>

<p>From design to hands-on coding up to infrastructure and operations, Fernando was the main driver of every technical solution of the company and a reference and inspiration for every employee inside and outside of the technical department.</p>

<p>He has an impressive talent for finding effective technical solutions to every kind of business requirement or issue and when designing software his style is clean, effective and simple. Through Fernando I learned the value of always being 100% committed to finding the most simple yet effective solution for every requirement. Instead of showcasing his talent through over-engineering or choices of hyped but unnecessary technologies, his main focus was always on delivering features that carry business value in the most agile, simple and maintainable way. You can always trust Fernando to deliver what the business needs, in the most effective way possible.</p>

<p>He was a very loved and appreciated leader in our company, his leadership style is direct and radically honest, Fernando is never afraid of speaking his mind or engaging in a difficult conversation if there’s an issue to solve.His authenticity has always inspired respect and admiration among his coworkers. At the same time his approachability and sense of humor make every interaction with him extremely enjoyable.</p>

<p>Above anything else, I consider him the most important mentor I had in my professional life. His ability and passion to transmit knowledge clearly, as well as an incredible amount of patience and dedication to the mentor role made possible for me and other developers joining the company to learn and grow immensely.</p>

<p>No matter the kind of problem or necessity, Fernando is always 100% committed to helping and delivering real value and I’m sure that this will be of immense benefit to every project or company he will work with.</p>

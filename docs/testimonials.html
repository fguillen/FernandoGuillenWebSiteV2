        <blockquote>
          <p>I had the honor and pleasure to work closely with Fernando for several years and I’m convinced that he is the most talented Engineer I’ve ever met. At that time he was the CTO of the company I joined and I could witness him building an impressive and complex distributed architecture from the ground up, an architecture that scaled flawlessly over the years up to millions of users sessions through several microservices and API integrations with third party partners. His talent in designing an elastic resilient and versatile system from the very start was what made possible for the company to keep growing exponentially and expand their business without technical constraints.</p>

<p>He is a well rounded engineer, he’s a passionate rubyst and a true talent in full stack development with Rails, but he is also able to jump into every technology and learn it in no time.</p>

<p>From design to hands-on coding up to infrastructure and operations, Fernando was the main driver of every technical solution of the company and a reference and inspiration for every employee inside and outside of the technical department.</p>

<p>He has an impressive talent for finding effective technical solutions to every kind of business requirement or issue and when designing software his style is clean, effective and simple. Through Fernando I learned the value of always being 100% committed to finding the most simple yet effective solution for every requirement. Instead of showcasing his talent through over-engineering or choices of hyped but unnecessary technologies, his main focus was always on delivering features that carry business value in the most agile, simple and maintainable way. You can always trust Fernando to deliver what the business needs, in the most effective way possible.</p>

<p>He was a very loved and appreciated leader in our company, his leadership style is direct and radically honest, Fernando is never afraid of speaking his mind or engaging in a difficult conversation if there’s an issue to solve.His authenticity has always inspired respect and admiration among his coworkers. At the same time his approachability and sense of humor make every interaction with him extremely enjoyable.</p>

<p>Above anything else, I consider him the most important mentor I had in my professional life. His ability and passion to transmit knowledge clearly, as well as an incredible amount of patience and dedication to the mentor role made possible for me and other developers joining the company to learn and grow immensely.</p>

<p>No matter the kind of problem or necessity, Fernando is always 100% committed to helping and delivering real value and I’m sure that this will be of immense benefit to every project or company he will work with.</p>

          <p>I can recommend Fernando as a very experienced software architect and tech leader.</p>

<p>He has very good business knowledge and always pushes to understand product and business needs before offering a technical solution. As a product manager, I was always happy to have him as a sparring partner because he could meaningfully challenge given assumptions and help to find the easiest way to test them.</p>

<p>Fernando is also a very talented software architect, the core system that he developed at Dalia proved itself to be scalable and easy to maintain. Fernando always thinks holistically about the system and tries to foresee future changes, at the same time he is very pragmatic and strives for simplicity. The combination of these traits allows him to create the best solutions for the business.</p>

<p>Fernando also is a great person to work with. He is honest and direct and at the same very empathetic and cheerful.</p>

          <p>Fernando is probably the most gifted and complete engineer I have ever worked with. When I joined Dalia he was the one-man engineering team, handling everything from frontend, backend to DevOps. During that time he not only maintained the platform but built new features that allowed the company to grow from a few hundred to millions of users.</p>

<p>Fernando combines his excellent engineering skills with a holistic view of the product he is working on. He does not only think in features and tickets but has a keen interest and ability to understand the context of his work. This character trait makes him an invaluable asset to any team as he can really bridge the gap between technology and business.</p>

<p>Fernando has a curious and creative mind and is always trying out new technologies and ways to approach a problem. However, when it comes to building a solution he will not make any compromises and always choose the technology that best fits the problem - he is 100 % results driven.</p>

<p>I have personally benefited greatly from Fernando’s leadership and mentorship qualities. When I joined Dalia as a junior data scientist he always dedicated time to share his technical knowledge with me, even in hectic situations. He has a great way of challenging people to improve themselves and their work. When you present your ideas to Fernando you know that they will be better and more refined afterwards.</p>

<p>Apart from that Fernando has a great character and humor which make him very easy to work with. He has a natural way of creating a great environment for the people around him. I remember many moments where he defused a stressful or tense situation with a funny remark or joke.</p>

          <p>Fernando is one of the most insightful and effective engineers and engineering leaders I have ever worked with. He constantly strives to get the best possible understanding of the business needs of the product and then turns them into software at a breath-taking speed.</p>

<p>A lot of people preach an &quot;agile&quot; or a &quot;lean&quot; approach to building products but Fernando actually lives those principles. He is always on the lookout for the simplest way to test an idea or a hypothesis and constantly pushes the people around him to do the same. But even when the time comes to make something complex and technically challenging he is there to translate the complicated requirements into easy-to-understand concepts.</p>

<p>The data-reach high-load products and systems that Fernando built at Dalia over 5 years ago practically on his own continue to serve the company and being built upon which is a testament to his ability to create software architectures with a long-term scalability in mind.</p>

<p>He is an incredibly patient listener and communicator and just an extremely nice colleague to be working with.</p>

                    <h2>Helping Business to develop Technology Products and Technical Architectures</h2>
                    <p class="fs-5 col-md-8">Hello, I am Fernando, I am original from Spain but living last decade in Berlin. I am experienced full stack web developer with substantial background building small and big technical products. I can help you to build the technology
                        product and technical architecture your business needs.</p>

                    <p>Full-stack web developer, primarily using Ruby On Rails and associated technologies.</p>
                    <p>I am a specialist in getting technology products out of the ground, from the design idea to the fully functional application. Orientation to produce production quality but also quick feedback loops: delivering quick and iterate. In
                        this area I have worked for many start ups and as well as personal business projects. As a “solo contributor” or as part of a small or big engineering team. As a senior developer or leading the architecture decisions.</p>
                    <p>Most recently in my role as a Co-founder and CTO of a fast growing technology company I was hands-on directing the implementation from scratch of an architecture that now supports more than 50K requests/min. Leading the technology
                        decisions of a team of ~ 80 members.</p>
                    <p>I have worked in a variety of roles over the past ~20 years - sometimes as a "solo" developer, or in a small team; and more recently within larger technical organisations. I primarily work on Rails applications, but have a solid exposure
                        to development across the full web development stack.</p>
                    <p>At one time or another, I have been in charge of: prototyping, implementing deployment CI based processes, cloud based servers administration, working on or directing scrum teams, working hand by hand with the product team, suffering
                        the hell of having to make C level decisions, micro services, high load traffic, fraud prevention, performance monitoring, auto scaling, terabytes sized dbs, …</p>
                    <p>I've also had plenty of exposure to different languages including python, C#, Java. And of course most of the modern JS frameworks like React and VueJs.</p>
                    <p>... But Ruby is what I enjoy working on most.</p>
                    <p>I have had the luck of having been always rounded by incredibly well talented people. I have learnt everything I know from them. I owe everything I know to the people of the teams I have worked in, to the community around open source,
                        web development in general and Ruby in particular.</p>
